<p>I was thinking a lot this week about my dad, and a thing my uncle said about his guitar playing. "It's really unusual to see someone who is so enthusiastic, and yet so untalented." Or something like that. Said lovingly, and fair. Monday, we busted out our first HTML lesson, and that was how I felt. It was a lot of fun, but I harbored no illusions about my greatness. I also didn't feel too bad about it, since I knew a lot of the fancy CSS 3 tricks some of the women were doing were things they'd known before they got to class.</p>

<p>I'd been feeling pretty ahead of the curve for the last few weeks, like my background in Python had really been giving me a leg up in Ruby, and so I just figured I was seeing some of the women with the HTML and CSS backgrounds get their time to shine. Just as knowing it wasn't a direct comparison in the past few weeks kept me humble, now it was keeping me from judging myself too harshly. And it was really neat to see some of the other things people were working on. So, I just focused on making my site what I wanted, and along the way figured out some pretty neat things.</p>

<p>Instead of making a personal website like most people were doing, I fleshed out a small Ruby application I'd made as a joke: a "horoscope" that returns several random adjectives about yourself from a single array no matter what your sign. I quickly realized I'd need a dropdown menu, and also that I didn't want to manually write every sign in the menu, since they all went to basically the same page. With a TA's help I learned how dropdown menus worked with a few place holders, and then after that I was shocked to learn how easy it was to inject Ruby into my html and use locals and params to auto generate the pages for each horoscope. As you can see in my second drop down on this page it's still working.</p>

<p>By Wednesday, something cool happened. Suddenly we were lecturing on the topics I'd figured out earlier in the week. This is the second or third time this has happened to me, and I can never decide whether to be proud that I was grokking what was the right path to be taking with things, or annoyed that I spent my time learning something that was always going to be covered and jealous of people who spent their time exploring something that was maybe judged less important by the instuctors, but which would also benefit them. All that, plus a teacher's pet instinct to make sure people knew that I figured it out myself, and that I'm not just following along. But I have gotten several extra places to use locals, a bigger cooler example using params, and tons or experience doing Ruby interpolation in my websites, which I don't think many other people have done, so all in all, time well spent. Also, by the end of the week I had someone on each side of me wanting me to show them how I made my dropdown menu. So, pretty good for someone with no previous html experience, yeah?</p>
