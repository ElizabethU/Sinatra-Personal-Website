Good news, internet! It’s been a couple weeks, and while being very busy securing my rails knowledge (that stuff is glued in there and will never leave me), and being introduced to JavaScript by the wonderful and patient Jeff Lembeck, I have managed to carve out a little of my free time, and build the secret twitterbot I was dreaming of. Or at least a basic prototype. By the way, if you're a classmate reading this, you should absolutely email me, I'm dying to gush about her, but no one in class knows. Her name is katherynebutler, and so far she tweets randomly, favorites and retweet other people’s tweets. I’ve been testing out getting her to reply tonight, but that’s going to be the sketchiest part of the whole operation, so I’m keeping it small in scale.

For those of you who are new readers, I am building a twitterbot to be a fan toward a particular classmate (I’m waffling between two) on twitter. This twitter bot will favorite and retweet their tweets with alarming, but not mechanical, regularity, hopefully prompting a level of befuddlement about who this person is, and why they find my classmate so interesting. The first problem with that was I realized that if they clicked on this twitterbot’s profile and there were no tweets, it would be really apparent it’s a bot. So, I built a series of functions for Kathy, where every hour when her program gets called, she searches a list of ‘hobbies’ I have given her, selects a random one to tweet about, searches tweets with that word or phrase that have happened since the last time this process was run, then filters them to remove replies, since the person being replied to would get confused, tweets with pictures, since those pictures would link to someone else’s twitter account, and tweets with words that are highly correlated with inappropriate tweets (a list I have to keep adding to all the time), and then chooses a random tweet from that. 

Except for 12am-8am when presumably she is sleeping, there is then a twenty percent chance she will tweet the text of that tweet. The tweet gets saved regardless, and it’s ID becomes the new parameter for the oldest tweet to search from next time. This last bit may seem unnecessary, but getting a recent tweet is the key to her tweeting she wants her morning coffee at 9 am and tweeting she can’t get to sleep now because she’s had too much coffee at 9 am. Saying time appropriate things is important.

Another thing I realized could out her as a twitterbot is having no friends. Therefore, I’m creating several other twitterbots with the same program running (but different ‘hobbies’) to be her friends. These twitterbots will also run the random favoriting and retweeting programs, but pointed at Kathy and each other, making each of them appear more real. 

Nonetheless, she’s not perfect. The beauty of twitter is at 140 characters she doesn’t have to elaborate on her situation, or appear incredibly clever. If she says weird things, she can pass for a boring person, or someone who doesn’t exactly get what most people consider social media to be for. If I’m getting her close enough to the Turing Test that she just looks like a weird person on the internet, the kind that would send chain letters back in the day, and post snopes failing news story statuses now, then I’ve done a fine job. Next I’ve just got to figure out how to let her talk to people directly without immediately giving herself away.

I plan to unleash her on one of my classmates in a few days, and then hopefully have them not figure it out until the next Seattle RB meeting two weeks from now. Then I’d love to reveal her as a lightning talk.

I’m thinking of unleashing her on either Anne or Davida in class. Both tweet regularly. Anne’s tweets seem more suited toward the type of replies I could provide, and is also someone I know will notice and start stalking the bot. Davida would care less, which would be less funny, but I am more sure would not be mad at being dragged into my lightning talk as the subject. Also, she called my trolling weak the other day, so this would show her. Instructors, I’d love your input. Classmates, if you are reading this for some reason, I’d love yours, too. If you are Anne or Davida, you should definitely contact me so I won’t sic the bot on you.

You can expect the code on github in a couple of weeks, when this is all public. Next time maybe I’ll tell you about the remote server, crontab, and API stuff this project required me to learn.
